# covid19-closed-pop-models

This project repository is for models of COVID-19 in closed population settings developed by researchers at the [_The Kirby Institute_](https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/). It currently only contains a spreadsheet model of CoV-SARS-2 transmission within prison settings and the subsequent impact of COVID-19. Further models and tools for other closed population settings are in development.

## Prison model

The model of COVID-19 in prisons is contained in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet `COVID-19_Incarceration_Model-v1.0.xlsx`. This spreadsheet model builds on the spreadsheet developed by [Recidiviz](https://www.recidiviz.org/) (original spreadsheet model available [here](https://github.com/Recidiviz/covid19-dashboard). It was developed with funding from [Corrective Services NSW](https://www.correctiveservices.justice.nsw.gov.au/) and [Justice and Forensic Mental Health Network](https://www.justicehealth.nsw.gov.au/). 

The aim of the model is track an outbreak of COVID-19 in a prison setting and the potential impact of prevention strategies and interventions. The main directory contains a blank spreadsheet model ready for use. Example spreadsheets with inputs and outputs are available in the `Examples\` directory. 

### Summary of the model 

The model is a simple compartmental deterministic model of CoV-SARS-2 transmission and COVID-19 progression within a prison setting. It includes inmates, correctional staff, health care staff, and family visitors. It is designed to be flexible and to compare intervention scenarios. Specific interventions incorporated include reductions in population size, effects social distancing, quarantine at reception, isolation of inmates in cohorts, PPE, screening of staff and visitors.
